## Simulation of organisms(Nlobs) in Pygame!

This is my first upload to github.

The intention is to make en easy tweakable simulation of organism floating around search for food or mates to reproduce.

The properties should be inherited from the parents in some way.

Properties might change over time or as the organism eats food.

Food should affect the organism in one or several ways, eg speed, ability to reproduce.

Blobs should have a prio to find food if they are hungry. if they are full try to reproduce.
